# SVM
Heart disease prediction using svm
An SVM classifier, or support vector machine classifier, is a type of machine learning algorithm that can be used to analyze and classify data. A support vector machine is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. The Support vector machine classifier works by finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes. The Support vector machine algorithm is also known as a max-margin classifier. Support vector machine is a powerful tool for machine learning and has been widely used in many tasks such as hand-written digit recognition, facial expression recognition, and text classification. Support vector machine has many advantages over other machine learning algorithms, such as robustness to noise and the ability to handle large datasets.
